Description: utility to check for available package upgrades
 A script, timer and apt configuration to check if package upgrades
 are available, notify the user and let them inspect them in a terminal
 before taking their preferred action.
 .
 The actual apt upgrade process is not handled at all.
 .
 NOTE: Without systemd the timer will be inactive and
 the notification will be triggered by apt updates only.
