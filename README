bunsen-apt-update-checker
=========================

This is a utility to check if package upgrades are available,
and, if so, to let the user inspect them in a terminal before
taking their preferred action.

The actual apt upgrade process is not handled at all.

The check is run 10 min after login, and every 24 hrs subsequently.
The check is also triggered by dpkg or apt activity.
The timer uses systemd, but the package will still function using
the apt triggers only, so systemd is a Recommends, not a hard dependency.
